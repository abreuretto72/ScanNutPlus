        <h1>Privacy Policy - ScanNut+</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 20, 2026</p>

        <p><strong>Multiverso Digital</strong> ("we," "our," or "developer") built the <strong>ScanNut+</strong> app as
            a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Multiverso Digital and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

        <p>By choosing to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will
            not share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, we may require you to provide certain information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Name, email, and password entered during registration.</li>
            <li><strong>Pet Data:</strong> Name, breed, age, weight, medical information, and your pet's clinical
                history.</li>
            <li><strong>Media (Camera and Microphone):</strong> Photos, videos, and audio captured specifically for
                analysis within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Location (GPS):</strong> Approximate or precise location data when using the Map or Walk Diary
                features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Generative AI Processing (Google Gemini)</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>ScanNut+</strong> actively uses Generative Artificial Intelligence technologies, specifically the
                <strong>Gemini</strong> API (provided by Google), to process visual, audio, and text data to generate
                predictive health and wellness reports for animals and plants.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> When you submit a photo, video, or audio file, this file and
                associated metadata are securely and anonymously transmitted to Google Gemini API servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Exclusive Purpose:</strong> The transmitted data is used <strong>exclusively</strong> to
                generate the requested analysis within the app's interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> All analyses generated by Gemini are for guidance only. They <strong>DO
                    NOT</strong> replace professional veterinary evaluation, diagnosis, or treatment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Records and reports (PDFs) build up the health history on your device and are
                synced to our secure servers (Google Cloud/Firebase).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Deleting a Pet profile <strong>irreversibly erases</strong> the entire
                history of consultations, AI analyses (Gemini), appointments, and associated media for that profile from
                our active databases.</li>
        </ul>
